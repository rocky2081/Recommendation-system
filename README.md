This is a sample project that is trained on a dataset from kaggle called Customer behaviour and Shopping habits dataset.
I have used a Train Test split to train this data.
I have used Collobarative filtering with surprise.
Since item id is not available in i have created an item id and later changed that id to item purchased for effective understanding in the output.
